Development Instructions:

1) when page loads, javaScript starts a new game.
	1a) also must create a button to start a new  without page reload

2) A secret number btw 1 - 100 should be generated

3) the user must input number and click button to guess-user guess is logged

4) user receives feedback in div#feedback is too high or too low

5) input is cleared so that user can make next guess

6) user receives feedback in whether next guess is closer or further
	6a) later on,  maybe want to give more detailed indications

	ex:(>50 ice cold), (<5 super hot) 

7) game tracks # of guesses the user has made
	7a) - span#count should default to 0 when the page loads

8) game supplies users with a list of numbers they've guessed so far - this as <li> in ul#guesslist

9) game notifies user of correct answer and offers to restart
